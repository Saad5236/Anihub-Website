                    <h3>Personality Description</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the franchise, regardless of Piccolo's allegiance, his general demeanor has always
                        been stern, if not grumpy, with an indifferent attitude towards others. Piccolo rarely smiles
                        and enjoys solitude. Piccolo is frequently seen meditating in quiet places and drinking thawed
                        ice water in the north area.[3] However, he shows a noticeable cockiness when fighting. He can
                        also be very confrontational toward people, showing very direct and honest opinions about a
                        situation or an individual. Piccolo is known for his very precise and efficient methods in
                        battle and likewise is shown to be very analytical and tactical in battle, able to see through
                        his opponent's skills and weaknesses to devise effective strategies for victory. In the Baby
                        Saga, Baby openly acknowledged Piccolo as one of the most brilliant fighters in the galaxy.</p>

                    <p>Originally, Piccolo inherited his father/former self's desire for world domination and destroying
                        Goku. He was determined to prove his superiority and possessed many of the villainous properties
                        of his father, such as a violent and destructive nature and a total disregard for anything
                        besides victory. This was shown during his battle with Goku in the 23rd World Martial Arts
                        Tournament, where he shows almost no mercy for his opponent, breaking all of Goku's limbs while
                        laughing sadistically, believing it was necessary after what Goku had done to his father.
                        Despite all this, Piccolo was not without a measure of restraint and honor, as he for no reason
                        saved a mother and daughter from debris during a storm.[11] He also let Krillin walk away after
                        submitting in the tournament. Piccolo has also shown traits of pragmatism, teaming up with his
                        archrival Goku and later the rest of the Z Fighters when the threat of the Saiyans proves to be
                        too much for him alone, citing the aliens' defeat as a shared goal. According to Goku, his
                        overall evil nature became more of a stubborn and angry attitude than flat-out villainous.
