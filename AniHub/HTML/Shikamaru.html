                    <h3>Personality Description</h3>
                    <p>Shikamaru is naturally a lazy person and his inclination is to do as little work as possible. As
                        an Academy student and even during his early career as a genin, Shikamaru is able to get away
                        with this, spending his days sleeping, watching the clouds, or playing games of shōgi and Go.
                        His goal is to live unremarkably, free of anything of noticeably good or bad, and then to die
                        just as unremarkably as he lived.[11] When he is faced with the potential for conflict or
                        commitment, he responds first by saying, "how troublesome," and then by trying to find some way
                        out of it, either by pretending to be indisposed or even outright saying that he doesn't want to
                        do whatever it is.</p>

                    <p>Although Shikamaru describes himself as "the number one coward",[13] he has a strong moral
                        compass and dedication to his friends. It is these qualities that earned Chōji Akimichi's
                        friendship, as Shikamaru was one of the first people to look past his weight and find value in
                        who he naturally was.[8] It is also these qualities that force Shikamaru to move away from his
                        lazy pursuits, as he finds himself volunteering to do work or to sacrifice himself if it will in
                        some way benefit his allies.[13] Such selflessness, once displayed during the Konoha Crush,
                        exacerbates his "troublesome" situations: he is given the responsibility of leading his friends
                        into battle, for which reason he does everything that he can to keep them safe, for which reason
                        he is given even more responsibility over even more of his friends, and so on. He still clings
                        to his lazy origins as much as he can; even if he can't spend his entire day being idle, he at
                        least avoids having long-term goals or confessing any particular pleasure in the duties he's
                        assigned.
