                    <h3>Personality Description</h3>
                    <p>Originally as an infant Saiyan, Goku was very timid, constantly crying for attention. Goku was
                        then programmed with intense hostility to carry out his mission of eradicating all sentient life
                        on Earth. When found by Grandpa Gohan, he was unruly, savage, and aggressive, wanting nothing to
                        do with the elder, although this was seemingly only when worked up, as when initially found by
                        Gohan, he quickly took a liking to the old man. However, after the head injury that caused him
                        to lose his instinctual aggression, Goku became well-known for the energetic, kindhearted, pure
                        heart and caring personality traits he inherited from his mother Gine. He was taught to be
                        respectful to others by Grandpa Gohan. He takes most situations in stride, he rarely lets things
                        get him worked up; he quickly got over losing his tail each time. He is however not without
                        fear. Goku is shown to be submissive to overbearing women like Bulma and Chi-Chi, even to the
                        point of Master Roshi jokingly declaring that for all his universal-class might, he is terrified
                        of his wife.</p>

                    <p>In the anime, he also has aichmophobia; a crippling fear of needles. He is not beyond feeling
                        sorrow, most noticeably seen from the loss of his grandfather. He is not above feeling shame, as
                        he regrets his lack of maturity as a person despite all the teachers who have helped him and
                        likewise wants to make his loved-ones proud of him. He also shows genuine concern for the
                        well-being of those close to him. When Master Roshi seemingly died against Ganos, Goku
                        frantically rushed to his aid, desperate to save his mentor and shed tears of joy when he
                        managed to revive him.
