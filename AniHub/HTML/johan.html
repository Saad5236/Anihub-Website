                    <h3>Personality Description</h3>
                    <p>On the surface, Johan is a well-mannered, charismatic, and compassionate yet somewhat aloof young
                        man who possesses a myriad of favorable traits and can easily overwhelm individuals with his
                        seemingly flawless nature, as seen with Hans Georg Schuwald, who describes him as being not of
                        this world.[8] This meticulously crafted facade makes it easy for him to make new allies and
                        manipulate them into doing various deeds for him through the influence of his supposed
                        friendship and good will. With such skill in creating this sense of perfection and pureness,
                        Johan hides his true motives with ease.</p>

                    <p>Within this contrived exterior, however, Johan callously delivers destruction and suffering to
                        those who happen to fall prey to his schemes. Even before his tenure at Kinderheim 511, Johan
                        still exhibits psychopathic tendencies. For example, most of his murders, both in childhood and
                        adulthood, have been premeditated and calculated.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many of Johan's beliefs run consistent with nihilism, as he does not see any meaning to life. He
                        claims, "Most of this universe is 'death' anyway," and that to the universe, "most lives are
                        just specks in a corner of the earth, gone in a flash".</p>
                    <p>
                        Johan also has a tendency to make his victims experience the worst possible loss and suffering
                        rather than actually killing them himself; this experience often leads to the victims killing
                        themselves, however. Helmut Wolf is a prime example of this; instead of simply being killed,
                        Wolf is forced to watch as all of his close relatives and acquaintances die, one after another,
                        all so he can feel what Johan felt, solitude.
