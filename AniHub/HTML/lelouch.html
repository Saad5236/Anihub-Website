                    <h3>Personality Description</h3>
                    <p>Lelouch is a highly intelligent individual who is also calm, sophisticated, and arrogant due to
                        his
                        aristocratic upbringing. While at school, Lelouch conducts himself as a sociable, likable, and
                        often
                        easygoing student. However, this is really a mask to hide his true nature. While as Zero his
                        true
                        nature
                        is expressed. His charisma and beliefs in justice gain him the trust and respect of many
                        soldiers
                        and
                        leaders.</p>

                    <p>Lelouch is known for having a very stoic personality. He never cared about schoolwork, seeing the
                        entire
                        thing as trivial, even though his high intelligence would make it easy for him. At one point,
                        Shirley
                        stated that if Lelouch applied himself in school, he could get high grades. He enjoys seeking
                        out
                        challenges, often playing chess against the nobility. In general, Lelouch takes most day-to-day
                        affairs
                        with open disinterest, often not even noticing the affection of others, especially Shirley, his
                        classmate. He has a strong dislike for nobles, viewing them as tepid and "overprivileged
                        parasites."
                    </p>
                    <p>In battle, Lelouch is very cold and tactical. He is willing to sacrifice civilians and soldiers
                        alike, if that is what it takes to achieve the objective. In the battle at Narita, when he
                        created a landslide that wiped out most of the enemy forces, and indirectly, several civilians
                        in the town below, he brushed off the civilian casualties as a simple "mathematical
                        overestimation." He did have second thoughts when he learned that one of them was Shirley's
                        father, but he accepted that there will always be consequences for all of his actions. He also
                        saw no problem with collapsing a large portion of Tokyo, resulting in countless military and
                        civilian casualties.</p>
