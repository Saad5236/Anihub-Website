                    <h3>Personality Description</h3>
                    <p>Light is characterized as hardworking, talented, and a natural genius. Highly perceptive and good
                        with problem solving, Light was a skilled planner and good at mapping out scenarios.
                        Furthermore, Light was very popular among peers and adored by his family members. However, his
                        high intelligence and constant praise from adults laid the foundation for an intense level of
                        hubris which quickly took effect once he obtained the notebook.</p>

                    <p>Similar to his father, Light has a strong sense of justice but this quickly becomes warped after
                        he becomes tainted by the notebook’s power. Believing the world to be "rotten," he uses his
                        Death Note as a means by which he can enact his will to rid the world of evil people. Light's
                        main goal is to create a new world that is free of injustice and populated only with people whom
                        he deems honest and kind, thus becoming the "God of the new world". Light is decisive and driven
                        to achieve his ambitions, without faltering one bit in his beliefs. Despite knowing the
                        criminality of murder, Light would consider his actions the ultimate “sacrifice” to help the
                        world.</p>

                    <p>Through use of the Death Note, Light quickly begins to develop a cold and ruthless nature. As a
                        utilitarian, he will take any means in order to achieve his goals. His actions do put his family
                        in harm’s way, though he does continue to love them regardless. This is demonstrated when his
                        sister is kidnapped; he prevents his father from taking drastic action as a way to keep his
                        sister safe in spite of the fact that Mello would gain the Death Note.</p>
