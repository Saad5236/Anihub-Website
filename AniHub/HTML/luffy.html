                    <h3>Personality Description</h3>
                    <p>Luffy's personality is like that of a child's, in the sense that he tends to go to the extremes.
                        He can either be extremely greedy, especially in cases of food, who his crew is, and adventure;
                        or extraordinarily selfless, going so far as to virtually sacrifice himself to avenge or protect
                        his friends, crew, and family. This childish mentality of his allows him to get to the root of
                        the problem, and allows him to figure out the most simple way of solving it.</p>

                    <p>He almost never gets irritated with normal people, though there are a few exceptions, like when
                        they seem to have an opposite taste in food as he, or when they ask if they can take a look at
                        his "privates". Luffy also has no problem with other people stretching and playing with his
                        rubber body, however, he does get a little irritated if they are doing so while he is in the
                        middle of eating.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another interesting personality trait is that during sailing, he likes to sit on the bow of the
                        ship, such as the head of the Going Merry and the Thousand Sunny, the nose of Rocketman, the
                        head of the right Yuda of the Kuja Pirates' ship or even on top of the front cannon of a
                        captured Marines' ship.</p>

                    <p>Luffy acquired the reputation of a very dangerous person because of his recklessness and even
                        insanity. However, unlike other pirates who have a reputation as a psycho (like the Killer of
                        the Marines Caribou or Bellamy) for unjust violence against civilians or authorities, Luffy
                        gained his reputation for helping his friends in the face of power, usually passing over beyond
                        the bounds of reasoning.</p>
