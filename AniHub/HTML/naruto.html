                    <h3>Personality Description</h3>
                    <p>Naruto is described as loud, cheerful, energetic, and stubborn. This make others believe that he
                        is similar to the First Hokage. Whenever frustrated or excited, he would end his sentences with
                        "Dattebayo!" (だってばよ!). Naruto has a number of childish traits, like keeping his money in a
                        chubby, green-frog wallet he affectionately calls "Gama-chan", being a very picky eater (he
                        almost exclusively eats ramen everyday and is a frequent customer at the Ramen Ichiraku bar),
                        but he has a sweet tooth when he ate gum during his childhood along with being afraid of ghosts.
                    </p>

                    <p>Despite his quirks and the criticism that follows them, Naruto is said to have a personality that
                        draws people to him, inspiring friendship and loyalty through acts of genuine kindness that
                        could change a person's worldview. He is thus able to build meaningful relationships that he
                        lacked during his childhood. Due to never experiencing love from his parents, and having no
                        girls at the Ninja Academy ever showing any attraction to him. Naruto never truly understood the
                        real meaning of "love", and always thought of loving someone the same as loving ramen. However,
                        whenever someone dear to him is in trouble or the situation calls for it, Naruto can be very
                        serious, and will instantly come to their aid.
                    </p>

                    <p>While as naive as he appears to be throughout most of the series, Naruto has proven to have a
                        keen eye to certain things most people don't see, showing that he can be smarter than what most
                        people, especially Sakura, are willing to give him credit for when he wants to be, something
                        even Choji comments on once in a while. This was shown when Naruto was the first to notice the
                        differences in Sai's book, then when he later on helped to decipher Jiraiya's dying message left
                        from Fukasaku on his back and managed to help solve the message through Kakashi's Icha Icha
                        book.</p>
